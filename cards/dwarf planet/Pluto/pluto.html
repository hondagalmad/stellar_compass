      <br>
      <p>
        Pluto has a thin, icy atmosphere mainly of nitrogen, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide.
        Its surface is covered with ice and rocky regions, and it has large plains and mountains.
        Pluto's atmosphere expands when it is closer to the Sun and freezes onto the surface when it moves farther away.
